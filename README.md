## Warlight custom ladders

Warladder is a tool that allows users of the strategy-game Warlight to create their own ladder competition. This tool works using the CLOT API that Warlight offers for this purpose.

This software is currently running on [warladder.net](http://warladder.net).

## Requirements

To run this, a member-account is required. This can be a personal account for testing, but as all games created by warladder show up in your games list, it is recommended to create a dedicated warladder account.
